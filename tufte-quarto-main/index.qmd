The Tufte-Quarto project is an homage to [Edward Tufte](#sec-tufte). It simplifies the production of books using a layout that resembles [his books](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi)[@Tufte:vdqi; @Tufte:en; @Tufte:ve] with a companion website. The goal is for the book and website share the same aesthetics.
