# Known-issues

1. Tufte-book can't handle label inside caption.

    Tufte-book.cls breaks when processing the line bellow:

    ```qmd
    ![A way of flying](/Images/goya.jpg){.column-body #fig-goya}
    ```
    which becomes:

    ```tex
    \begin{figure}

    {\centering \includegraphics{Images/goya.jpg}

    }

    \caption{\label{fig-goya}A way of flying}

    \end{figure}
    ```
    
 2. Can't render svg image in pdf and can't render pdf image in html.
    - current solution is quite ugly: 

    ```qmd
    ::: {.content-hidden unless-format="pdf" }

    ![IBT "genealogy" tree.](/Images/dissertation-map.pdf){.column-margin width=90%}

    :::

    ::: {.content-hidden unless-format="html"}

    ![IBT "genealogy" tree.](/Images/dissertation-map.svg){.column-margin width=90%}

    :::

    ```
    For avoiding duplicating code, files are .svg in html by defaul and .pdf in pdf.
    So you can only:

    ```qmd

    ![IBT "genealogy" tree.](/Images/dissertation-map){.column-margin width=90%}

    ```

3. Tufte-class works only until subsection -> `### subsection`; `#### subsubsection`-> returns error

4. sidecite is duplicating citations in the same margin. Solved this same problem in my dissertation and in the kaobook class. Only problem is that Tufte-book class is a little too cryptic for me.
